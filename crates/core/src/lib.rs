//! Crate `hudi-core`.
//!
//! # The [config] module is responsible for managing configurations.
//!
//! **Example**
//!
//! ```rust
//! use hudi_core::config::read::HudiReadConfig::InputPartitions;
//! use hudi_core::table::Table as HudiTable;
//!
//! let options = [(InputPartitions, "2")];
//! HudiTable::new_with_options_blocking("/tmp/hudi_data", options);
//! ```
//!
//! # The [table] module is responsible for managing Hudi tables.
//!
//! **Example**
//!
//! create hudi table
//! ```rust
//! use hudi_core::table::Table;
//!
//! pub async fn test() {
//!     let hudi_table = Table::new("/tmp/hudi_data").await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
